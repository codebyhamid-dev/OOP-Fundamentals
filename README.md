**OOP Fundamentals**

A C# project demonstrating the four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.
The repository contains multiple classes and examples that help beginners and developers understand how OOP works in real-world scenarios, with clear comments and structured code.

🚀 **Features**

Encapsulation examples with data protection and controlled access

Inheritance examples demonstrating code reuse and method overriding

Abstraction examples with abstract classes and specialized implementations

Polymorphism examples allowing objects to behave differently based on context

Interface examples combining multiple roles and enforcing contracts

Clean, organized, and well-commented code for easy learning

Modular class structure for scalability and maintainability

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

C#

.NET Framework / .NET Core

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

Console-based examples for simplicity and clarity

📂 **Project Structure**

The project is organized to demonstrate each OOP pillar separately:

**Encapsulation** – Person class with private fields and validation properties

**Inheritance** – Student class inheriting from Person and overriding methods

**Abstraction** – Employee abstract class with derived OnsiteEmployee and RemoteEmployee

**Polymorphism** – Shape abstract class with Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle implementations

**Interfaces** – GraduateStudent class demonstrating multiple role implementation

Each folder and class is self-contained, making it easy to explore, understand, and expand with additional examples.
